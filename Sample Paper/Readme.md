CO2 Code Repository
===================

This is the code for the paper ["Increase in the Amount of CO2 and Ocean Heat Content"](paper_link).


Abstract
--------

After a week spent meticulously agreeing the exact wording, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
has just released a summary of the first part of its major report reviewing the science of climate change.

Selected results from the paper
--------
Our analysis shows that the increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is correlated with the increase in oceans' heat content. See the figure below.

Executing the Code
---------

1. First, download the IPython notebook, either from this [GitHub link](https://github.com/saloot/IPythonClass/blob/master/Sample%20Paper/Paper%20Code/CO2Example.ipynb)
or directly from [this link](http://some_links) (we recommend the GitHub method).
2. Open a terminal/command line window and move to the directory the IPython Notebook is located. 
3. In the command line, type

    ```ipython notebook```
4. Consequently, a browser window pops up. Navigate to the browser window and select the IPython Notebook. 
5. You can then adjust parameters of the code and run different decoders.


### Required Packages
* A working distribution of [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* The code relies heavily on [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org).
* It also depends on several other standard Python packages, such as [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html), [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html), [getopt](https://docs.python.org/3/library/getopt.html), [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) and [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html).

### Tested on...
The code has been tested on Mac OS X 10.7, 10.8, 10.9, and on Ubuntu linux.
