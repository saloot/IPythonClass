{"name":"CO2 and Heat Content: A Rising Trend?","tagline":"","body":"CO2 Code Repository\r\n===================\r\n\r\nThis is the code for the paper [\"Increase in the Amount of CO2 and Ocean Heat Content\"](paper_link).\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n--------\r\n\r\nAfter a week spent meticulously agreeing the exact wording, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\r\nhas just released a summary of the first part of its major report reviewing the science of climate change.\r\n\r\nSelected results from the paper\r\n--------\r\nOur analysis shows that the increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is correlated with the increase in oceans' heat content. See the figure below.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://documents.epfl.ch/users/s/sa/salavati/public/IPythonClassPhotos/AtmosphericCO2.png\" width=600>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nExecuting the Code\r\n---------\r\n\r\n1. First, download the IPython notebook, either from this [GitHub link](https://github.com/saloot/IPythonClass/blob/master/Sample%20Paper/Paper%20Code/CO2Example.ipynb)\r\nor directly from [this link](http://some_links) (we recommend the GitHub method).\r\n2. Open a terminal/command line window and move to the directory the IPython Notebook is located. \r\n3. In the command line, type\r\n\r\n    ```ipython notebook```\r\n4. Consequently, a browser window pops up. Navigate to the browser window and select the IPython Notebook. \r\n5. You can then adjust parameters of the code and run different decoders.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Required Packages\r\n* A working distribution of [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\r\n* The code relies heavily on [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org).\r\n* It also depends on several other standard Python packages, such as [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html), [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html), [getopt](https://docs.python.org/3/library/getopt.html), [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) and [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html).\r\n\r\n### Tested on...\r\nThe code has been tested on Mac OS X 10.7, 10.8, 10.9, and on Ubuntu linux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n2013-2015 (c) Author 1 and Author 2.\r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons\r\nAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
