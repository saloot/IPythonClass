<h1>1. Introduction<br></h1> Python is a very popular general-purpose language, with all the modern and classic constructs of a programming language that every software developer appreciates. This is what makes Python beneficial over MATLAB, besides the fact that it is not proprietary and various open source python distributions are freely and publicly available.


However, the very fact that Python is a general purpose language and not a software specific to scientific computing may be considered a drawback of it, too. To address this problem, several scientific computing packages (i.e. sets of function,classes,...) have been developed and released for it&nbsp;so far. These packages contain a large variety of functions which can solve everyday computational problems of researchers in many fields of&nbsp;engineering and science.


But the remaining problem is to find, install, maintain, manage updates and retain the consistency among all such packages as well as the Python system itself. This is&nbsp;where Anaconda comes in.



<a name="ana" title="Link: null"></a><h2>2. Anaconda</h2> Anaconda is a completely free Python distribution (i.e. set of packages) for scientific purposes, as stated in their website. It contains more than 125 Python packages for science, mathematics, engineering and data analysis.

Installing Anaconda will not only give you an out-of-the-box ready python system as well as a fully-featured IDE (Integrated Development Environment), but also it will release you from the burden of manually installing and taking care of dependency and consistency requirements between various packages.
