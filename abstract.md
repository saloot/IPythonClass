Reproducible Research using IPython
===================================

A large part of modern research is increasingly supported by sophisticated computer run algorithms.
As such, these algorithms have become an integral part of the information needed to reproduce
scientific results in all fields. Even when the publication is accompanied by data, it is not enough
if the algorithms are not available to make sense out of it.

Luckily, tools that can help researchers to make their computational results reproducible are available.
IPython is such a tool. It relies on Python, a robust open source and general purpose programming language.
IPython comes with IPython notebooks, a unique tool that is very well suited for sharing the results of computational
research. It also allows users to perform interactive computing as well as exporting the notebook to a variety
of other document formats.

During this workshop, we will demonstrate how this tool can support research by drawing examples
from various fields such as biology, physics, and mathematics. A short introduction will be 
followed by an extensive hands-on session.
