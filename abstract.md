Reproducible Research using IPython
===================================

A large part of modern research is increasingly supported by sophisticated computer run algorithms.
As such, these algorithms have become an integral part of the information needed to reproduce
scientific results in all fields. Even when the publication is accompanied by data, it is not enough
if the algorithms are not available to make sense of it.

Luckily, tools that can help researchers make their computational results reproducible are available.
IPython is such a tool. It relies on Python, a robust open source and general purpose programming language.
IPython comes with IPython notebooks, a unique tool very well suited for sharing computational
research result. It allows in addition to do interactive computing as well as export to a variety
of other document formats.

During this workshop, we will demonstrate how this tool can support research by drawing examples
from various fields such as biology, astronomy, and mathematics. A short introduction will be 
followed by an extensive hands-on session.
